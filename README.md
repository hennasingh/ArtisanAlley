# Artisan Alley

Artisan Alley is a directory of local arts and crafts market in Ireland. The site is built using Django, Python, and Postgres database for the portfolio project 4 of Code Institute's Full Stack Development Diploma.

## User Experience - UX

### Skeleton

The wireframes for mobile and desktop were created using Balsamiq. These were the original ideas but they changed as I learned and progressed in the actual development of the website. Some of the features will be implemented in future versions.
